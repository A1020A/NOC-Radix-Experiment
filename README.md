# NOC-Radix-Experiment
This repository is in prepareation for a research project for possible router topology in 3D monolithic intergration for the routing between 3D stack memory and compute units. 
multiple NOC schemes and topology is researched and synthesized through cadence genus to find their relative tradeoff in area, power(dynamic) and frequency.
